# The Tinkerbell Bootstrap
We have a problem.

We have three or more Proxmox nodes, capable of hosting VMs, but we have only a single VM.

We need to be able to create more VMs, and we need to be able to do it quickly and easily.

Enter [Tinkerbell](https://tinkerbell.org).

## What is Tinkerbell?
Tinkerbell is a bare metal machine provisioning system. It allows you to define a machine's configuration in a declarative way, and then provision it with an operating system automatically.

## The plan
We'll first setup Tinkerbell within a VM, and then use it to provision the rest of our VMs. Later, once all of our VMs have been setup, we'll lay a Kubernetes cluster over the top of them, and then install a permanent Tinkerbell installation on top.

Once this is done, interestingly, we'll be able to use Tinkerbell to re-provision and reinstall any machine in the lab, including the machines that are running Tinkerbell itself.

## Enabling nested virtualization
We're going to enable a feature called Nested Virtualisation. If you're building a modern platform (see [TODO: Hardware]) and Proxmox VE, you'll likely already have this enabled. Either way, check out [this guide](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Nested_Virtualization) for information on how to verify that it's available in your environment. In particular, you should go to your VM and check if it has "Host" as the CPU type.

We'll be using this to run a VM *inside* our VM, which will then run Tinkerbell allowing other machines on the network to be setup and provisioned automatically.
