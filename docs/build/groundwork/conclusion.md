# Conclusion

You've built the basics of a home lab cluster.

Specifically, you have:

* A Proxmox cluster, with multiple nodes, which can later be expanded to include more nodes or explore something called `hyperconvergence`.

* A basic understanding of how to use Proxmox, including how to create VMs and containers, and how to use the Proxmox web interface.

* A virtual machine on which we can install software and get to know the basics of Linux and our infrastructure.

* A highly available DHCP and DNS setup, which can be used to provide DHCP and DNS services to the entire network.

Great work so far!
