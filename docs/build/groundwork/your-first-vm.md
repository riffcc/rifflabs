# Your first VM

Now it's time to create a virtual machine in the Proxmox cluster, which will be the first of many. We'll use this VM to run a few different services, and we'll use it to learn how to manage VMs in Proxmox. We'll also use it as a basic way of testing that our new DHCP and DNS setup is working properly, and that our network is configured correctly in general.

## Creating the VM
Log into the Proxmox web interface. This will be at https://your-node-ip:8006. You'll be presented with a login screen. Enter your username and password, and you'll be taken to the Proxmox dashboard.
